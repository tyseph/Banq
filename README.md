# Banq
BanQ is a web app designed for the SNU community to help them manage their expenses and keep a track of their money. BanQ aims to establish itself as the go to app for the student community in order for them to effectively manage their monthly budgets. BanQ has three primary functionalities. It enables users to log in their expenses with a SME specific interface. It allows the users to channelise their budgets and lastly allows seamless splitting of bills across users. The idea is to empower the students with the knowledge of their spendings and enable them to save as much money as possible. We also aim to streamline the consumer experience on campus.
